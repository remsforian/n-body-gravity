# n-body-gravity
A simulation of the n body problem involving bodies of equal mass orbiting under gravity

This is a scallable simulation of gravity. I am using rescaled units so if you want to use this for real data you will need to find a conversion to "real" unit. 

If you want to scale this simulator you can go to the ```#define N 3``` and change it to the number of dimentions you want to simulate. 

You can also change ```#define D 3``` to change the number of dimentions (currently it is in 3d). I wouldn't reccomend going to one dimentions, and higher than 3 would be hard to visualize, but you do you. 

My plotting sceme uses Mathematica which is a propriatary program. I am working on using python (probably through blender) to plot the bodies, but if you don't have mathematica at the moment you'll have to find another way to visualize your data.
